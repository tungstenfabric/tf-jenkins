  This is the preparation of the future readme. Now only some of the points of using the system are contained here.

## Running jobs
We provide the ability to run jobs to check your patchsets sent for review. A template is a sequence of jobs. You can see all possible templates in the `config/templates.yaml` file.

### Check
Each project is associated with several templates that are launched by default when a new patchset is loaded. You can see the list of projects and associated templates in the `config/projects.yaml` file.

To independently initiate the review of templates related to the current project, add a comment to your review
